# .emacs.d

This is my attempt at a modular .emacs.d config. When I want my emacs config on a new machine, I simply run `./emacs-install` which creates a symlink from `~/.emacs.d` to the repo folder. Then everything automatically installs the first time I open emacs. 

Special thanks to @crshd -- much of this code is copied from his emacs config.
